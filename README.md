## Objective
The primary objective of this laboratory is to explore the use of regular expressions to solve practical problems encountered while working with text files or text input. 
This project focuses on leveraging regular expressions in Python to process natural language texts, program logs, code files, and more.

## Overview
This laboratory consists of a series of Python programs designed to manipulate and process data using regular expressions. 
The aim is to handle various text processing tasks without relying on traditional control structures (e.g., for, while, if) but rather through the power of regular expressions.
